Indigenous Resistance in the Shadow of the 1780 Peru Rebellion
The Shadow of the Andes
In 1780, there was an Indian village under the majestic Andes Mountains in the Viceroyalty of Peru. For centuries, the indigenous people of this land had lived under the oppressive ruling of Spanish colonizers. Heavy burdens, such as the forced labor in the Potosí silver mines (mita), the harsh taxes levied on basic necessities (alcabala), and the cultural disrespect, left the people struggling for living. The older people still talked about the days when the Inca Empire was strong and prosperous, while many families struggled to maintain the way of life under this relentless exploitation. The prosperity in memory and the exploitation in reality further exacerbated their discontent.

Whispers in the Wind (Growing Unrest)
The Bourbon Reforms were launched during this period, aiming at strengthening central control and increasing revenue. Based on these requirements, the local corregidor has issued a new rule, further increasing the sales tax (alcabala) on essential goods. This pushes the community closer to the risk of starvation.
A Spanish tax collector arrives in your village who is known for his cruelty, asking for immediate payment. The forced purchase of unwanted and overpriced Spanish goods (the reparto system)  often leads to debt and further exploitation.

Travelers from neighboring villages bring news of a growing rebellion led by Túpac Amaru II. He has claimed to be a descendant of the last Inca emperor, and aims to achieve an end to the mita system and other injustices and reform the ruling system. They speak of his capture and execution of the cruel corregidor, which generates both hope and fear in the hearts of the people.
You discuss these rumors with a respected elder in your village. He shares stories of past uprisings and the potential dangers and opportunities of joining such a movement. The Bourbon Reforms also affected the wealth and status of the Kurakas, which could influence their stance on the rebellion and the situation may be negative to the rebellions.
